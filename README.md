# Earthquake-Analytics
A Folium based visualization website to give an insight into the earthquake-prone regions around the globe

This website provides all the possible visualizations based on the analytics performed on the dataset which includes a record of the date, time, location, depth, magnitude, and source of every earthquake with a reported magnitude of 5.5 or higher since 1965. The visualizations include:
1. Magnitude Category (Magnitudes Greater than 8, between 5.5 and 8)
2. Heatmap based on the magnitude
3. Null values analysis
4. Magnitude Histogram with KDE
5. Depth analysis
6. Types of earthquakes etc.

Tech Stack:

1. Frontend - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
2. Backend (Analytics) - Python (Folium library for map integration)
