      <h5>The above countplot depicts the types of <b>MAGNITUDE</b> based on how the magnitude is calculated. <br>
Magnitude Type can be based on any of the following: <br>
    <ol>
     1. ML:             Local (Richter) magnitude - The Richter magnitude of an earthquake is determined from the logarithm of the amplitude of waves recorded by seismographs. <br>
     2. MS:             Surface wave magnitude scale - It is based on measurements in Rayleigh surface waves that travel primarily along the uppermost layers of the Earth. <br>
     3. MW (Mw):        Moment magnitude scale - It is a measure of an earthquake's magnitude ("size" or strength) based on its seismic moment (a measure of the "work" done by the earthquake). <br>
     4. MD (Md):        Duration magnitude/signal duration - It is based on the realization that on a recorded earthquake seismogram, the total length of the seismic wavetrain ,reflects it's size.<br>
     5. MH : Non-standard magnitude method. Generally used when standard methods will not work. Sometimes use as a temporary designation until the magnitude is   finalized.<br>
     5. MB : A magnitude for regional earthquakes based on the amplitude of the Lg surface waves as recorded on short-period instruments. Only authoritative for smaller events in the central and eastern United States, typically <4.0 for which there is no mb or moment magnitude.<br>
     6. MWW : Derived from a centroid moment tensor inversion of the W-phase (~50-2000 s; pass band based on size of EQ). Computed for all M5.0 or larger earthquakes worldwide, but generally robust for all M5.5 worldwide. Provides consistent results to M~4.5 within a regional network of high-quality broadband stations. Authoritative USGS magnitude if computed. <br>
     7. MWR : Based on the scalar seismic-moment of the earthquake, derived from moment tensor inversion of the whole seismogram at regional distances (~10-100 s; pass band based on size of EQ).<br>
     8. MWB : Derived from moment tensor inversion of long-period (~20-200 s; pass band based on size of EQ) body-waves (P- and SH).<br>
     9. MWC : Derived from a centroid moment tensor inversion of the long-period surface waves (~100-2000 s; pass band based on size of EQ). <br></ol>
     
<b>Conclusion</b> : The bars of the countplots depict the count of types of magnitudes based on the considered dataset.</h5>
